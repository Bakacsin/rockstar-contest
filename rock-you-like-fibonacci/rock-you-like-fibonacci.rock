Fibonacci takes the fire
The thunder is 1
The soul is 2
If the fire is as weak as nothing
Give back nothing

If the fire is the thunder
Give back the thunder

Put the fire without the thunder into your heart
Put the fire without the soul into my heart
Give back Fibonacci taking your heart with Fibonacci taking my heart


Shout "Give me a number!"
Listen to my voice
Say Fibonacci taking my voice
